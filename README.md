# Hackathon-Template

## Overview
Welcome to my demo of a hackathon website! This website is a project I made to learn more about Tailwind CSS and CSS animations to create a dynamic website when paired with React js. It took me about 12 hours over the course of 3 days to create, with a lot of time being due to fixing errors or styling. The website features various interactive components that trigger upon hovering the mouse cursor.

## Instructions
This website can be accessed through Vercel. Simply load up the page and hover over various components to interact with them. These interactions include expansions, colors, glow, and enlargements. You can also open and close various FAQ pages through using clicks. You can also utilize the navigation bar to automatically scroll to various points in the site.

## Motivation
I primarily built this project for two reasons: to study Tailwind CSS, and to produce a site of demo components for the Synthesis hackathon website team. I've been having a lot of fun with building sites for the Athena Award, and I want to learn more about good web design! Additionally, as a member of the team for the Synthesis hackathon, I'm helping out with the technical aspect of the web design, so I produced this site to demo various animations for the components the site implements. I intend to use this website as a general framework to discuss web design with my fellow Synthesis website developers.

## Challenges and Reflection
Most of the challenges of this project arose from fidding with CSS selectors, transformations, and transitions. While trying to build animations for the site, I had a lot of different elements bundled into one component that I wanted to animate. This gave me problems with using selectors, as trying to change one element when interacting with another was a challenge that didn't have too much documentation when I searched for potential solutions. As a result, I spent a lot of time trying different animations and selectors for transforms.
